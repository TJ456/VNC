## üéØ Questions Judges Might Ask

**Q: How does the ML model handle new attack patterns?**
A: The Isolation Forest provides unsupervised learning for unknown threats, while the system continuously updates baselines and can retrain models with new data.

**Q: What's the performance impact on VNC connections?**
A: Minimal - we monitor network connections passively without intercepting VNC traffic, ensuring no latency impact.

**Q: How does it scale for enterprise use?**
A: Architecture supports horizontal scaling with database clustering, load balancing, and distributed monitoring agents.

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: Multi-layered detection with confidence scoring minimizes false positives. Configurable thresholds allow tuning for different environments.

**Q: How does prevention work across different platforms?**
A: Unified firewall abstraction layer supports Windows (netsh), Linux (iptables), and macOS, with consistent API and management.
